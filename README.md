# ASP.NET Core MVC Fundamentals

I'm preparing for the Microsoft MVC exam and so this project is focused on exploring the fundamental pieces which go into an MVC application. 

I'm using this as a sandbox to explore the concepts covered by the exam and to get practice using them.

For more information check out the official exam page: [Microsoft - Developing ASP.NET MVC Web Applications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-486.aspx).
